        },
        {
          question: "When should we start antenatal classes?",
          answer:
            "We recommend starting classes in your third trimester, around 28-32 weeks of pregnancy. This timing ensures the information is fresh when you go into labor, while giving you time to practice techniques and ask follow-up questions during your remaining prenatal visits.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are classes only for first-time parents?",
          answer:
